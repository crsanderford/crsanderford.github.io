I'm Connor - a bioengineering student at Arizona State University, and a graduate of the data science program at Lambda School. I've previously worked as a Team Lead for Lambda School, leading a group of students through the data science curriculum.

üí° Currently interested in:

    Matrix factorization models, especially applying them to domains outside recommender systems.
    Strategies for high-dimensional, sparse data.
    L1-norm optimization and regularization.
    Functional programming.

üè≠ I'd love to contribute to projects involving:

    Use of factorization machine models outside recommendation.
    Development of libraries for using factorization machines.
    Usage of functional programming for machine learning.
